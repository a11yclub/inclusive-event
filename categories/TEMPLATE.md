# Category Template

This template should help you with creating a new category. To start a new category, 

1. create a **subdirectory** below the `/categories` directory and give it a **concise and descriptive name**,
2. **copy this file** (or the corresponding translation file) into the subdirectory and **rename it to `README.md`** (optionally including a [language identifier](../README.md#translations)),
3. **replace this introductory text** with something more meaningful and
4. optionally **remove those organizational stage headings** below which don't really apply for the new category. You might also keep them but leave them empty.
