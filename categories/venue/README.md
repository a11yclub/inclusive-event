## Scouting

We've compiled a questionnaire / checklist to go through for each individual location that we use for scouting a venue. We provide this as a separate document ([German only at the moment](Venue_Questionnaire.de.md)) so you can easily save or print it. The main topics covered are:

* Arrival / environment
* Access to the building
* Rooms
* Toilets
* Catering
* Security
* Personnel
* Technical equipment
* Stage
